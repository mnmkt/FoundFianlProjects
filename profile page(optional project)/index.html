                <h1>"Who is she?"</h1>
                <a>

                    <p><a class="biggerfont">M</a>INAMI KATO is a naturally gifted artist and passionate creator. From an early age, Minami recognized that she was different from her classmates in her native Japan, where conformity was a means of survival
                        and success. Although difficult at times, Minami's heightened sensitivity allowed her to see past this, and develop her own sense of the world.</p>

                    <p>Minami began classical piano training at the early age of 4 and developed perfect pitch by age 5. In addition to piano, Minami played French horn, tuba, guitar, bass guitar, and vocals. She was always around music throughout her childhood.</p>

                    <p>At the tender age of 18, Minami moved to Los Angeles and spent the next 7 years discovering herself without the cultural pressures she felt as a child. There was excitement, new experiences, new acquaintances, secrets, consequences,
                        discovery, development, and growth. Her experiences in this period may one day become part of her future memoir, but for now she has music to share with the world.</p>

                    <p>In 2009 she visited New York City for business. She immediately felt the city's strong magnetic pull and decided that she needed to move there immediately. Three months later she became a New Yorker and focused all of her energies
                        on her artistic endeavors.</p>

                    <p>Minami honed her craft while studying electronic music production at New York City's Dubspot. While attenting Dubspot, she completed the Electronic Music Producer/DJ Master Certificate Course, and received invitations to enroll in
                        two of their competitive scholarship courses. Her experiences at Dubspot made her realize that electronic music and sound as an art form were her true calling. A medium that brought together her interests in technology and art,
                        it was the obvious and natural direction.</p>

                    <p>In addition to her electronic music production, she studied clssic composition at the prestigious Julliard School. Minami currently resides and creates in Brooklyn, New York, and believes it to be her final destination where all of
                        her artistic work can be realized.</p>

                    <article>9/6/2017<br>".....<a class="biggerfont">I</a>t has been two month since I started coming to fullstack. Before bootcamp prep, I was a bookkeeper who was giving up music and only thing I knew about Javascript was "for loop". It has been
                        only two months but I came very far for sure. I always thought 2012 was the best year in my life because the year was the hardest working year for me and I liked it but now probably 2017 would be the new best one soon. It has been
                        really amazing at fullstack.
